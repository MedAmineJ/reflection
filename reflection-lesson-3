When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when you finish a commit and it's ready to be shared with others working on the project you create a remote

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
maybe you want to affect some changes in a certain time after affecting a logical change in your programme or you dont want to pull everything contributed to your project by others
